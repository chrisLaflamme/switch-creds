# switchcreds

SwitchCreds is a simple gem that allows you to switch back and forth between different Amazon Web Services (AWS) accounts via the command line.  This is achieved by automatically updating your ~/.aws/credentials file to point your AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) and AWS Software Development Kit (SDK) calls to the appropriate account.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'switchcreds'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install switchcreds

## Usage

In order to use this gem there should be a single 'credentials' file in your ~/.aws directory.  This file should be duplicated and stored in a 'credentials_example' file.  Credentials for all other AWS account must be stored similarly, ex. 'credentials_example1', 'credentials_example2'.  The following example shows three different accounts that can be switched into:
- ~/.aws/credentials
- ~/.aws/credentials_personal
- ~/.aws/credentials_company1
- ~/.aws/credentials_company2

In order to switch between accounts run:

```
$ switchcreds -s
```
You should see:
```

	0: personal1
	1: company1
	2: company2
```
Make a selection. 1 for example:
```
$ 1
********************************
* Using COMPANY1 creds now *
********************************
```
If you have the AWS CLI installed your creds can verified by running the following and comparing what returns with what S3 buckets you know to be in the account:
```
$ aws s3 ls
2017-XX-XX 17:44:20 pickles-the-drummer
2017-XX-XX 17:44:20 doodley-doo
2017-XX-XX 16:47:10 ding-dong-doodley-doodley-doo
```
